Here’s a sample `README.md` file for the Apple iOS Message App.

```markdown
# iOS Message App

This is an iOS application developed with Swift and SwiftUI, designed to fetch and display personalized messages based on user data. The app retrieves data from several API endpoints, including a personality API, messages API, and acceptance API, and dynamically displays relevant messages to users.

## Features

- **Fetch Personality**: Retrieve user personality traits from a designated API.
- **Fetch Messages**: Fetch personalized messages based on the user’s personality.
- **Sort Messages**: Messages are sorted based on a score, displaying the most relevant messages first.
- **Accept Messages**: Users can accept specific messages, which are then sent to an acceptance API.

## Prerequisites

- **Xcode**: Version 12 or later.
- **iOS**: Compatible with iOS 14.0 or higher.
- **Backend APIs**: Ensure the personality, messages, and acceptance APIs are running and accessible from your local network or internet.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ecosystemai/message-app-ios.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode.
   ```bash
   open ios-message-app/MessageApp.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Configure the API URLs:
   - In `SettingsView.swift`, update the default URLs for the `messagesApiUrl`, `personalityApiUrl`, and `acceptanceApiUrl` to match your server's configuration. These URLs can also be modified within the app’s Settings section.

## Configuration

The app includes a **Settings** page where you can customize the API endpoints:

- **Messages API URL**: Endpoint to fetch messages.
- **Personality API URL**: Endpoint to fetch user personality traits.
- **Acceptance API URL**: Endpoint to send accepted message data.
- **Web App URL**: URL to load a web view within the app.

These settings allow dynamic configuration and persistence across sessions.

## Usage

1. **Run the App**:
   - In Xcode, select your target device or simulator, and click **Run**.
2. **Fetch Messages**:
   - Enter a customer number in the provided input field and tap **Fetch Messages**.
3. **Accept a Message**:
   - Tap on any message to accept it, which will send the acceptance to the backend.

## Code Overview

### Key Files

- **MessageService.swift**: Handles API calls for fetching personality, messages, and accepting messages.
- **SettingsView.swift**: Settings screen where users can update the API URLs.
- **ContentView.swift**: Main view that displays messages and allows interaction with the API.

### API Endpoints

1. **Personality API**: Fetches the personality of the user based on customer data.
2. **Messages API**: Retrieves messages tailored to the user’s personality and preferences.
3. **Acceptance API**: Records accepted messages by sending relevant details to the backend.

## Testing

The app includes unit tests for basic functionality:

1. **App Creation Test**: Verifies the app component initializes correctly.
2. **Title Property Test**: Confirms the `title` property exists on the `AppComponent`.
3. **Render Title Test**: Ensures the title renders correctly in the user interface.

To run tests:

1. In Xcode, select **Product > Test** or press **Cmd+U**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot Connect to API**: Verify that your API servers are running and accessible at the URLs specified in the app’s settings.
- **Property Errors in Tests**: Ensure all properties (such as `title`) are correctly defined in the `AppComponent` to match test expectations.
- **Network Configuration**: Make sure the iOS simulator or device is on the same network as your API server (for local development).
